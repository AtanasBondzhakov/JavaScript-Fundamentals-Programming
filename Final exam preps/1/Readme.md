# Problem 1 - Registration

*John wants to register on a sales site, but too many people call him
John. It asks you to write a program that will generate an original
username.*

On the first line, you will **receive** **the username** that he wants
to use in the first place. On the following lines, you will be receiving
**commands** until the **"Registration"** command. There are **five**
possible commands:

- **"Letters {Lower/Upper}"**

  - **Replace** all letters with lower case or with upper case, then
    **print** the result.

- "**Reverse {startIndex} {endIndex}"**

  - **Reverse** the substring from the start index until the end index
    (both inclusive), then **print** it. Do **NOT** change it in the
    username.

> **Note:** Check if the indices are valid. If they aren't - skip the
> command. An index is valid when it is **non-negative** and **less than
> the size** of the collection.

- "**Substring {substring}"**

  - If the username **contains** **the** **given substring**, **cut** it
    out and **print** the result without the cut substring.

  - Otherwise, print:

> **"The username {string} doesn't contain {substring}."**

- "**Replace {char}"**

  - **Replace** all occurences of the **given char** with a **dash**
    (**-**) and **print** the result.

- "**IsValid {char}"**

  - For a username to be **valid,** it must contain **the given char**.
    If it is, print **"Valid username."**.

  - Otherwise, print: **"{char} must be contained in your username."**

### Input

- On the **first line,** you are going to receive the **string**.

- On the following **lines**, until the **"Registration"** command is
  received, you will be receiving commands.

- All commands are **case-sensitive**.

### Output

- **Print** the **output** of every **command** in the **format**
  **described** **above**.

### Examples

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 49%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>

<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>Input</strong></th>

## Problem 2 - Destination Mapper

*Now that you have planned out your tour, you are ready to go! Your next
task is to mark all the points on the map that you are going to visit.*

You will be given a **string** representing some **places** on the map.
You have to **filter** only the **valid ones**. A valid location is:

- Surrounded by **"="** or **"/"** on **both sides** (the **first** and
  the **last** symbols must **match**)

- After the **first "="** or **"/"** there should be **only letters**
  (the **first** must be **upper-case,** other letters could be upper or
  lower-case)

- The **letters** must be **at least 3**

**Example**: In the string
**"<span class="mark">=Hawai=/Cyprus/</span>=Invalid/invalid==i5valid=/I5valid/=i="**
only the **first two** locations are valid.

After you have **matched** all the **valid locations**, you have to
**calculate travel points**. They are calculated by **summing** the
**lengths** of all the **valid destinations** that you have found on the
map.

In the end, on the **first line,** print: **"Destinations: {destinations
joined by ', '}"**.

On the **second line,** print **"Travel Points: {travel_points}"**.

### Input / Constraints

- **You will receive a string representing the locations on the map.**

- **JavaScript: you will receive a single parameter: string.**

### Output

1.  Print the **messages described above.**

### Examples

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 63%" />
<col style="width: 36%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Input</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Output</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td
style="text-align: center;">'<mark>=Hawai=/Cyprus/</mark>=Invalid/invalid==i5valid=/I5valid/=i='</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><p>Destinations: Hawai, Cyprus</p>
<p>Travel Points: 11</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">'ThisIs some InvalidInput'</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><p>Destinations:</p>
<p>Travel Points: 0</p></td>

**Problem 3 - Bakery Shop**

*Maria is opening a bakery shop, and she needs your help to keep track
of the stock availability.*

Create a program that keeps the information about the stock at the shop.

You will be receiving **lines** with commands until you receive the
**"Complete"** command. The **possible** commands are:

- **"Receive {quantity} {food}":**

  - Add the **quantity** to the given **food**.

  - If the food **does not** exist, **add** it to your record.

  - If the **quantity is invalid** (\<= 0), ignore the command.

- **"Sell {quantity} {food}":**

  - If the **food** is **not in your record**, print: **"You do not have
    any {food}."**.

  - If there is **not enough quantity** of the wanted food, you should
    sell (decrease) **what you** **have in stock** and then remove **the
    food** from your record. Print: **"There aren't enough {food}. You
    sold the last {sold quantity} of them."**

  - Otherwise, **decrease** the **quantity** of the given **food** and
    print: **"You sold {quantity} {food}."**. If, **after reducing the
    quantity**, there is **0 amount of this food**, you should **remove
    it** from your record.

**You must keep track of all sold food quantities!**

In the end, you should **print the stock availability** in the format:

**"{food1}: {quantity}**

**{food2}: {quantity}**

**â€¦**

**{foodN}: {quantity}**

**All sold: {count of all sold food quantity} goods"**

**Input**

- You will be receiving lines until you receive the **"Complete"**
  command.

- The input will **always** be **valid**.

## Output

- **Print** the **stock availability** in the **format** described
  above.

- **Print** the amount of **all sold food** in the **format** described
  above.
